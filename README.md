I have implemented Logistic Regression using both sklearn and a manual implementation from scratch to compare their accuracy and performance. It gave me the same accuracy as naive bayes classifier which is 65%. I also implemented naives bayes using sklearn but it gave me the accuracy of 63%. Additionally, I have implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers to further analyze model performance on the dataset. Each model has been evaluated based on accuracy and classification reports to determine their effectiveness in classification tasks. Random forest classifier performs better than support vector machine.

I had implemented multiple machine learning models for resume classification, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Now I used hyperparameter tuning for both the SVM and Random Forest models to optimize performance. I evaluated the model performance based on confusion matrix, classification report and visualizing the feature importance on each model. The SVM and Random Forest models were saved using joblib. I am now working on the Flask application to allow users to upload resumes and receive predictions based on the trained SVM model. BERT embeddings were used for feature extraction to enhance model performance.
